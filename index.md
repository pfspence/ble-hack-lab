This lab walks through some tools that are used for hacking Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our target is a Bluetooth CTF project designed to allow users to learn about core concepts of Bluetooth client and server interactions. (<a href="https://github.com/hackgnar/ble_ctf_infinity">BLE CTF Infinity</a>)

## Tips for this lab

:warning: BLE devices are finicky. You may encounter errors when following this lab. Here are some helpful tips:
1. Don't be afraid to retry commands multiple times if you get an error. You will also see error messages when in fact the command was successful.
2. Remove and re insert the Bluetooth dongle.
3. Power cycle the BLE CTF device. (Progress will persist, but you will need to navigate to the challenge again)

## Tools

We can use a few different tools to solve some BLE CTF Infinity challenges.

- hciconfig
- bettercap
- gatttool

### Hciconfig

You can view BLE interfaces on you system by using the `hciconfig` command. You should see at least one interface.

### Bettercap

We need to discover the address of our target BLE device. There are many tools that can accomplish this. We will use <a href="https://bettercap.org">bettercap</a> in the command line.

Start bettercap (lab machine passwords: password)
```bash
$ sudo bettercap
```
Run recon to list discovered BLE devices. Note, there will probably be **many** discovered devices in crowded areas. You should turn off recon mode quickly after.
```
Â» ble.recon on
Â» ble.recon off
```
You should see similar output as below. We are looking for the address of devices named `BLE_CTF_SCORE`. There should be several. Choose one and copy the MAC address. This will be our target for the rest of the lab.

<img src="images/ble_recon.png" />

After running `ble.recon`, you can display discovered devices with additional info including signal strength, the chip vendor, and connection status.
```
Â» ble.show
```
<img src="images/ble_show.png" />

Now that we have found the address of our target, we can enumerate characteristics and services of what is running on the gatt server. Run the following command, replacing the MAC address with your selected target.

```
Â» ble.enum AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

<img src="images/ble_enum_0.png" width="84%"/>

This is the BLE CTF Infinity scoreboard, which nicely shows our progress. We should see that 0/10 flags are complete. There are also 2 important things we should take away from this:
1. We write all flags to handle `0x002e`
2. We navigate between challenges (flags) by writing a value between `0x0000` and `0x00FF` to handle `0x0030`.

The BLE CTF is made of multiple Gatt servers which we need to rotate through by writing values to `0x0030`


**Note**: We have be using `bettercap` in interactive mode. You can also run commands from a shell prompt.

```bash
$ sudo bettercap --eval "ble.recon on"
```

### Gatttool


We can use `gatttool` to write values to handle `0x0030` to navigate to different challenges. We can write `0000` to go to scoreboard at any time. This is also where flag 0 is.
```bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --char-write-req -a 0x00300 -n 0000  
```

When doing this, you will get the following error:
```
Characteristic Write Request failed: Request attribute has encountered an unlikely error
```
Don't worry about this. Its unavoidable because of the way the CTF was architected.



## Flag 0
There aren't clear instructions on what to do for flag 0 since it shares the same Gatt server as the scoreboard, but the 'Device Name' is actually the flag.

<img src="images/flag_0.png" />

Exit bettercap and use `gatttool` to write the value to where we submit flags, handle `0x002e`. (Remember to change the device MAC address)

```bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --char-write-req -a 0x002e -n $(echo -n "04dc54d9053b4307680a" | xxd -ps)
Characteristic value was written successfully
```

Now let's check the scoreboard. Go back into bettercap, run recon, and enumerate the device.
```bash
$ sudo bettercap
```
```
Â» ble.recon on
Â» ble.recon off
Â» ble.enum AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```
We should see that Flag 0 is now complete.

<img src="images/ble_enum_flag_0.png" />


## Flag 1

### Navigate to Flag 1 Challenge

Change the device to broadcast the challenge for flag 1.
```
gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --char-write-req -a 0x0030 -n 0001
```

### Failure Enumerating Characteristics
At this point, if we try to use `bettercap` to enumerate the characteristics, we see that `bettercap` hangs and never returns output like for the scoreboard.

<img src="images/ble_enum_hang.png" />


### Using Gatttool to Read Characteristics

Lets try to use the `gatttool` to figure out what is going on. Start `gatttool` in interactive mode.


``` bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -I
```
Connect to the device and list the primary services.
```
> connect
> primary
```
From there we can read the listed service handles. These don't provide anything that looks like a flag though.

<img src="images/flag_01_primary.png" width="75%"/>

Recall that we saw these handles and additional handles when using `bettercap`.

<img src="images/ble_enum_handles.png" width="75%"/>

Lets try reading from those.

```
> char-read-hnd 0x002a
```
<img src="images/flag_01_0x002a.png" width="70%" />

Remember that `gatttool` is showing us the values hex encoded. Use your preferred method of decoding this. <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=IDY3IDZmIDZmIDY0IDYyIDc5IDY1IDIwIGYwIDlmIDkxIDhi">Cyberchef</a> is an easy tool to use.

We see that the value `67 6f 6f 64 62 79 65 20 f0 9f 91 8b` decodes to `goodbye ðŸ‘‹`. This is followed by an error. It seems that we have been disconnected from the device. This most likely explains why we can't use `bettercap` to enumerate the device characteristics. Once it reads `0x002a`, it disconnects.

Reconnect and read `0x002e`
```
> char-read-hnd 0x002e
```
<img src="images/flag_01_0x002e.png" />

Decoding this hex shows gives us "write here to goto to scoreboard".

```
> char-read-hnd 0x002c
```
<img src="images/flag_01_0x002c.png" width="80%"/>

The value at `0x002c` decoded looks like a flag! Write it to handle `0x002e`.

```bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --char-write-req -a 0x002e -n $(echo -n "873c6495e4e738c94e1c" | xxd -ps)
```

### Check the Scoreboard
Navigate back to the scoreboard
```bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --char-write-req -a 0x0030 -n 0000
```
You can check your progress for flag 1 by using `bettercap` and `ble.enum`, or you can read the handle directly using `gatttool`.

```bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -I
```
```
> connect
> char-read-hnd 0x0036
```
<img src="images/gatttool_flag_1_complete.png" width="75%"/>

Decode the value with <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=NDYgNmMgNjEgNjcgMjAgMzEgM2EgMjAgNDMgNmYgNmQgNzAgNmMgNjUgNzQgNjUgMjAgMjA">Cyberchef</a>. You should see "Flag 1: Complete".


## Flag 2



## Flag 3

<img src="images/hciconfig_spoofed_mac.png" width="68%"/>


## Finishing up

Thats it for this lab. You are welcome to continue to try to
Reset the CTF by writing `0xC1EA12` to handle `0x0032`.

```bash
$ gatttool -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --char-write-req -a 0x0032 -n C1EA12
```
